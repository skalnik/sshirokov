# Various notes for future reference

* On May 5th, 2015 Part 1, Slava transformed. I asked if he liked margaritas to
  which he said "No". Shocked, I asked if he really wasn't a fan, at which point
  a transformation happened infront of my eyes. Slava exlaimed "No. Well
  sometimes. Yes. I like margaritas."
* There should be a chapter of slander. "Slava liked poop. Slava really liked
  poop. Slava liked poop to a point of it being weird. Slava smelled of poop.
  Slava bathed in poop. Slava ate poop. Slava found poop on the sidewalk and put
  it back into his butt so he could poop it back out. Slava made a poop
  milkshake and laughed while drinking causing nasal diarrhea."
* The first chapter should be about how amazing, level headed, and calm I am as
  I am as an individual, which is why I am so well suited to assess and write
  about Slava's life.
* Slava's 4 least favorite things are: Me, Twitter, Meatspace, and Changing
  twitter names
* Slava's favorite things are: Poop, Tacos (which are sandwiches), and
  Margaritas
* "Tacos are the photons of my existence" - Slava. This was said when explaining
  the taco sandwich duality. Tacos are sandwiches and sandwiches are tacos.
* June 13th 2015 Part 1: [An unusual pants day](pants%20day.md)
* Slava was born without eyes and had to harvest them from his first victim
