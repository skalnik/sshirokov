An unusual pants day for Skalnik
By: Slava Shirokov

It started as any other bike-day does for bike-skalnik. He got out of his bike-shaped bed, ran to his bike-themed bathroom and thought of bicycles as he took a fairly circular poop that he liked to imaged resembled a bike wheel. 

“What a wonderful day!” he exclaimed, as he pooped again and again, “I think I’ll poop forever and not even put on pants!” But the universe had other plans for bike-skalnik. Little did he know but a great bikedventure was awaiting him just as soon as he could get off the toilet for the fourth (or maybe fifth) time. 

By the mid afteroon, after all was bike-pooped and done, bike-skalnik decided to find some pants to wear in the outside world. He was looking for the pants he was wearing last night when he was thinking about bicycles. He was thinking of red bicycles, blue bicycles, green bicycles and all the colors in between. His head was filled thoughts of nothing but gears and chains when he finally stumbled on some pants.

“These aren’t the pants I want!” he proclaimed and pouted.

Momentarily, his thought was filled with a panic. He was very concerned about his pants. His favorite pants or nothing else. He went on looking, this time, thinking of bikes of multiple colors at the same time. 

But it was not to be. He got distracted some food.

He wandered over to the kitchen, where he remembered he put his bike-fridge. He pulled out some bike-shaped cookies and started to pedal them directly into his mouth.

“What an unusual pants day!” he proclaimed, and went directly back to sleep.
